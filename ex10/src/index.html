      <article><p>This is a book about instructing computers. Computers are about as common as screwdrivers today, but they are quite a bit more complex, and making them do what you want them to do isn’t always easy.</p></article>
      <ul><li><strong>On programming</strong><p>In the beginning, at the birth of computing, there were no programming languages. Programs looked something like this:</p></li>
    <li><code>00110001 00000000 00000000
        00110001 00000001 00000001
        00110011 00000001 00000010

 <article><p>Inside the computer’s world, there is only data. You can read data, modify data, create new data—but that which isn’t data cannot be mentioned. All this data is stored as long sequences of bits and is thus fundamentally alike.</p>

<header id="functions">Funcstions</header>
<article><p>Functions are the bread and butter of JavaScript programming. The concept of wrapping a piece of program in a value has many uses. It gives us a way to structure larger programs, to reduce repetition, to associate names with subprograms, and to isolate these subprograms from each other.</p><ul><li><strong>Defining a function</strong><p>A function definition is a regular binding where the value of the binding is a function. For example, this code defines square to refer to a function that produces the square of a given number:</p><code>const square = function(x) {
    return x * x;
  };
  
  console.log(square(12));
  // → 144</code></li></ul></article>
  <header id="objects_and_arrays">Objects and Arrays</header>
  <article><p>Numbers, Booleans, and strings are the atoms that data structures are built from. Many types of information require more than one atom, though. Objects allow us to group values—including other objects—to build more complex structures.</p><ul><li>Every now and then, usually between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m., Jacques finds himself transforming into a small furry rodent with a bushy tail.

  <ul><li><strong>Encapsulation</strong><p>The core idea in object-oriented programming is to divide programs into smaller pieces and make each piece responsible for managing its own state.</p></li></ul>
